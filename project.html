        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <h4>Problem:</h4>
        <p>Users need a photo storage program that is simple to use, works across platforms, and makes sharing possible to anyone.</p>
        <h4>Solution:</h4>
        <p>Keeps is a platform that was created with all users in mind. It shares and organizes photos and videos easily, and in ways that any user could understand.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="compet">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>
        <p>The first step of my research was to analyze what other cloud storage programs were out there. I chose Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest for this process and sorted through their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a SWOT Analysis.</p>
        <p>Through this exercise I was able to pinpoint some holes in the marketplace that my cloud storage program could exploit. The main takeaways were that these programs were too complex and would not appeal to users who didn’t use technology often. The other was that there was no program that is visually appealing, while staying out of the “social networking” category</p>

      <section class="survey">
        <h4>User Survey</h4>
        <p>After gaining my own insights on the competitors, I created a survey to gain an insight into how the general public felt about cloud storage programs.
The survey was taken by users from all over the country (a few international as well) and many varying ages and occupations. This variance was very helpful in determining that the answers weren’t just a result of a certain demographic.
Among those who use cloud storage programs already, the major takeaways were that they mainly use it for personal reasons, they want it to be less complicated, and they need to be able to upload photos from their device and collaborate with others.
For those who do not use a cloud storage program, the overwhelming majority do not use it because they are too complicated, but they would be open to a more simple program in the future. There seems to be a big gap in the market here for users who would use the features of a cloud storage program, but do not want to deal with all of the complexities of those currently in use.</p>

      <section class="personas">
        <h4>User Personas:</h4>
        <p>Based on my Competitive Analysis and survey I created User Personas to represent the target users of Keeps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><h5>Rebecca Ward</h5></li>
          <li><h6>Travelling Mom</h6></li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/becky.png" alt="smiling mom"></li>
          <li><h7>55 | Activities Director | Burlington, VT</h7></li>
          <li><h7>Bio:</h7> Rebecca is in the early stages of transitioning into retirement at her job in a small town, and frequently travels with her husband. Her daughters live in different cities and she loves hearing about what they are up to and showing them what she is doing as well. She is not very technologically savvy but still has a smartphone. Her job doesn’t require her to use technology at all.</li>
          <li><h7>Motivations:</h7> Rebecca currently does not use any cloud storage programs and does not use social media either. She currently emails most of her content but that is time consuming and the content does not fit in one email. Since she does not have an iphone, texting her content to others often greatly reduces the quality.</li>
          <li><h7>Goals:</h7>
<p>• Share collections of photos and videos from her trips</p>
<p>• Easy sharing since she doesn’t know a lot about technology</p>
<p>• Store and send high quality content</p></li>
          <li><h7>Frustrations:</h7>
<p>• Not having an iPhone restricts a lot of sharing features that she would normally be comfortable using</p>
<p>• Easily\derailed by the current cloud storage programs</p>
<p>• Uploading and sharing content takes her way too long</p></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><h5>Jillian Letourneau</h5></li>
          <li><h6>Thriving Millenial<h6></li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/jillian.png" alt="smiling mom"></li>
          <li><h7>27 | Marketing Director | Boston, MA</h7></li>
          <li><h7>Bio:</h7>  Jillian is a young professional with a busy job in the city. She doesn’t have much free time, but she likes to visit her friends and family across the country when she can. She lives with her Fiance and their dog and will be getting married this year. She is very good with technology and is always looking for apps that make her life more convenient.</li>
          <li><h7>Motivations:</h7>  Jillian currently really only uses cloud storage programs for work. She has social media and shares some photos through iCloud services, but that does not necessarily reach everyone and definitely not at the same time. She wants her photos and videos to be sent in high quality and have a place she can send them with other content all together.</li>
          <li><h7>Goals:</h7>
<p>• Put all of her photos, wedding ideas, and travel in one place</p>
<p>• Share content with anyone she wants... but not everyone</p>
<p>• Share photos based on tags</p></li>
          <li><h7>Frustrations:</h7>
<p>• Too many different cloud programs/apps that do different things.</p>
<p>• Does not want her content to be public</p>
<p>• Annoyed when the quality of her content gets reduced.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="stories">
        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <h4>User Stories:</h4>
        <p>Based on the user personas and keeping in mind that Keeps had to be a simple program, I created user stories in order to identify which features would be most important to include.
The most important features that I landed on for returning users were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/check.png" alt="">I want to upload content</li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/check.png" alt="">I want to share a single item with someone else</li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/check.png" alt="">I want to share a folder or group of items with someone else</li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/check.png" alt="">I want to connect with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/check.png" alt="">I want to log in to my account</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="flows">
      <h4>User Flows:</h4>
      <p>Next I turned the user stories into user flows to determine how they would be enacted in the program:</p>

      </section>

      <section class="sketch">
        <h4>Sketches and Wireframes</h4>
        <p>I began putting my research and branding into action with my wireframes. I started with sketching the screens that would accurately depict what was drawn up in the user flows. These sketches were then developed into lo-fi wireframes. From these wireframes I created a clickable prototype and had the first round of usability testing. This testing was crucial to influencing my final designs, and ultimately resulted in two major changes. The complete removal of the “share link” function of the program as testers deemed it unnecessary, and taking the “about” section off the homepage because it was information overload.</p>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="brand">
        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <h4>Name:</h4>
        <p>The name appeared after I realized the word “Keeps” continuously appeared in my analyses and mind mapping exercises early in my research. By being a short and simple word, it sticks with the themes I want the program to adhere to, and the word goes well with a cloud program and can be easily used for slogans. Examples would be: “Keeps all of your content in one place” “Keeps your content secure” “Keeps cloud storage simple.” Originally the name had been “Keyps” but since this is a program all about simplicity, the original words seemed more fitting.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="logo">
        <h4>Logo:</h4>
        <p>The logo came about after many variations and concepts were explored. Different versions of keys, locks, save icons (or floppy disks as I still see them...), and plays on the letter K were created. Eventually the key was what came up the most, and the simplicity combined with the similarity to the name became the deciding factor. Originally, the key itself had two lines coming out from it to create a “K” shape. While it made the logo more memorable, it was quite busy which detracted from the simple brand image that is meant to be portrayed.</p>

        <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/keepshifilogos.png" alt="" id="fig">
      </section>

      <section class="color">
        <h4>Color:</h4>
        <p>While there is plenty of white space to highlight simplicity, the other bright colors were used as to demonstrate that Keeps is targeted for personal use and not professional use.
The main color for the brand is a green/blue. Green and blue are both colors that are perceived to be comforting and soothing, as Keeps is designed to be a solution for complicated overly professional cloud platforms. This color is also light and not very strong, this combined with the second yellow color which depicts happiness, also helps to demonstrate that it is meant to be fun and personal rather than formal.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/greeno.png" alt=""><p>#30C1B8</p></li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/yellowo.png" alt=""><p>#FFC700</p></li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/blacko.png" alt=""><p>#000000</p></li>
          <li> <img src="portfolio/images/keepsimages/whiteo.png" alt=""><p>#FFFFFF</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- <section>
        <h4>Typography:</h4>
        <p>For typography I originally chose two fonts, Lobster Two and Montserrat. Lobster Two is an easy to read cursive font that is more memorable than a standard font. It also has a lot of personality to it which helps reiterate that this program is targeted more for personal use than professional use. Montserrat is simple and balances Lobster Two out which would help it maintain a minimalist presentation.
All of these elements together resulted in my original logo below:
This logo would eventually be transformed to its final version based on research gathered in the next section.</p>

      <section class="testing">
        <h3>Prototypes & Final User Testing</h3>
        <p>By compiling all of the branding, design, and research I had built so far, I created the high fidelity mockups for Keeps. Through rounds of in person and virutal testing as well as meeting with a senior designer, I made several changes before landing on my final iterations. Below are examples of the changes to the logo and homepage I made based on all of this feedback:</p>

            <li><p>3. Header line not needed</p></li>
            <li><p>4. New font for headers to match new logo</p></li>

      <section class="conclusions">
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>I grew and learned a lot as a designer from creating Keeps from start to finish:</p>
        <p><h7>Every stage in the design process is important, there are no shortcuts.</h7> If I ever felt that I didn’t need a step or I would be fine pushing ahead, it always resulted in going back and having to redo a lot of my work. Learning to trust the process was difficult for me but once I finally figured it out the hard way, it made me a much more efficient designer.</p>
        <p><h7>Outside opinions are crucial.</h7> I never would have been happy with my final result if I didn’t conduct testing or have other designers give their thoughts. Tunnel vision became very real for me on this project and I am very thankful I was able to harness this input so effectively into my final design.</p>
        <p><h7>Mistakes are okay and neccessary.</h7> Looking back through the stages of this project, the design came a long way from where I started. The evolution of the design and iterations are needed for a successful final project. Trial and error will never hurt you when it comes to design.</p>
